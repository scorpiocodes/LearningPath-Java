## JAVA

Java is a general-purpose programming language that is 
class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few 
implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let
application developers write once, run anywhere 
(WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all 
platforms that support Java without the need for 
recompilation.[16] Java applications are typically compiled 
to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 

The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer
low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was 
one of the most popular programming languages in use according
to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, 
with a reported 9 million developers.
